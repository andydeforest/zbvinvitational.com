      events and activities, the undersigned Participant acknowledges, understands, and agrees that:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Participation in the Tournament is completely voluntary. The Participant agrees to comply with the stated and
      customary terms and conditions for participation in the Tournament. If, however, the Participant observes any
      unusual significant hazard during his or her presence or participation, the Participant will remove himself or
      herself from participation and immediately bring such hazard to the attention of the Tournament organizers.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The undersigned is familiar with the Tournament, and the activities in which the Participant will be
      participating, and the undersigned is solely responsible for determining whether his or her fitness or skill level
      warrants participation in the Tournament activities. The undersigned is aware that these activities may be

      <strong>
        3. The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has been declared a worldwide pandemic by the World Health Organization.
        COVID-19 is extremely contagious and is believed to spread mainly from person-to-person contact. As a result,
        federal, state, and local governments and federal and state health agencies recommend social distancing and
        have, in many locations, prohibited the congregation of groups of people. Attending the Tournament and related
        events and activities could increase your risk of contracting COVID-19. The Releasees have put in place
        reasonable preventative measures to help reduce the spread of COVID-19; however, the Releasees cannot guarantee
        that you will not become infected with COVID-19 at or during the Tournament, its related events and activities.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      4. THE UNDERSIGNED KNOWINGLY AND FREELY ASSUMES ALL HAZARDS, DANGERS, AND RISKS, both known and unknown, WHETHER
      ARISING FROM THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE RELEASEES OR OTHERWISE AND RELATING TO THE TRANSMISSION OF THE COVID-19 VIRUS,
      and assumes full responsibility for his or her participation in the Tournament, and its related events and
      activities.
