      <h2>About the Golf Tournament</h2>
      <p>
        We're Zeke's legacy, the army of friends. We're here to honor his name and memory and do something that would
        make him proud, but do it in a way that would make him laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zeke's game was golf. He played well, but not too seriously. With him on a golf course there was play with a
        purpose along with a chance to laugh about something. He loved everything about it, especially its social side.
        So, a tournament in his name is a natural to bring people together.

        Purpose and laughter are what it's all about. This tournament is 100% volunteer-operated. All the proceeds
        support community organizations as well as cancer research and awareness programs. That's the purpose and it's
        serious.
      </p>

        The laughter? Hey, it's an army of friends having a great day in September at the course. There is always
        laughter.
