      <h2>About the ZBV Memorial Fund</h2>
      <p>
        In early 2014 Zeke Bondy-Villa was very busy. His fledgling business was really growing and gaining clients, he
        was president of his Rotary Club chapter and he was helping with preparations for the wedding of his son, Adam.
        He wanted an outdoor kitchen with a massive pizza oven, so in his spare time he was building it by hand. Zeke
        had a lot going on. Then again, he always did. He was the buddy you could rely on. He always made the right
        choice. He was light-hearted and fun loving. When you saw him he made you feel good. He just did things the
        right way. Zeke had an army of friends and he also had cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
        He'd survived cancer twice before, but this time was different. The army of friends came together to provide
        care and support and grandma's cure-all, but even chicken soup was no match for metastatic renal sarcoma. He was
        gone the following March.
      </p>
      <p>So, yeah. Cancer sucks.</p>
      <p>Still, you're probably wondering who are we and what's this got to do with golf?</p>
